I"ÿ<p>My research insterests include speech generation and voice conversion (VC). In my PhD career, my studies are basically on speech-related task. One of them is to enhance
the performance of conventional voice conversion by sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. And 
I further extended the seq2seq based VC into non-parallel scenario by learning disentangled 
representations. As a visiting 
research student in University of Edinburgh, my research is mainly on speech recovery from 
tongue and lip videos.</p>
